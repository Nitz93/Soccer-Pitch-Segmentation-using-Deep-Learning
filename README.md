Soccer Pitch Segmentation using Deep Learning was done as part of my MSc project


# Abstract
Convolutional neural networks and deep learning are becoming increasingly popular in the area of computer vision. Convolutional neural networks are frequently utilized in computer vision applications including object segmentation and recognition in photos and videos. A convolutional neural network known as UNET is provided in this study for automated pitch/playfield detection on soccer Images. The neural network was trained and tested using a dataset of Soccer images that included both high-resolution and low-resolution images. Various data augmentation approaches are used on the generated training and test sets. UNet neural network with different deep networks such as ResNet34, VGG, Densenet as encoders are evaluated and results are been compared to determine which has the better performance. The training procedure was optimized using the adaptive moment estimation algorithm (ADAM). The quality of the proposed models is measured using metrics such as the F1-score, IoU, Dice Score, and Specificity value.
